    The issues in this assignment are practical in nature, and the functionality provided will help finish more class assignments in the future. Given that JavaScript libraries are readily available, we could probably solve any JavaScript tasks were given with a few lines of code that called a library procedure. If your JavaScript code for the aforementioned issues is clear, understandable, and devoid of ESLint warnings, then these standards will be satisfied.
